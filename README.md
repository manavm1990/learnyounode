I have tried to 'modernize' the solutions AMAP.

## Notes ðŸŽ¶

I did not give much care for error handling. It's not much necessary for such simple scenarios as these exercises.

- 'Make It Modular' - I am using `async`-`await` and therefore my 'module fxn' doesn't not need a '3rd callback parameter'. [GitHub Issue #716](https://github.com/workshopper/learnyounode/issues/716)
